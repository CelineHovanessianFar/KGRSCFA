# 3: PRINCE: Provider-side Interpretability with Counterfactual Explanations in Recommender Systems

The researchers developed a method called Prince to generate explanations for recommendations within a heterogeneous information network (HIN) using counterfactual reasoning. They used Personalized PageRank (PPR) to evaluate the impact of specific user actions (like purchases or ratings) on the recommended items. By identifying minimal sets of user actions that, if removed, would change the recommendation, Prince provides concise and actionable explanations, all computed efficiently using a polynomial-time algorithm.

The paper discusses "Prince," a novel method for generating explanations for recommendation systems using counterfactual evidence within heterogeneous information networks (HINs). These networks include various nodes and edges representing users, items, and their interactions such as purchases or ratings. The core idea is that understanding why a particular item was recommended can enhance user trust and satisfaction.

Prince provides explanations by identifying minimal sets of user actions (like purchases or ratings) that if absent, would lead to a different recommendation. This approach focuses on the direct actions of the user, avoiding privacy issues that arise from exposing the actions of others, which is common in path-based explanation models.

The method operates under a counterfactual framework, where it computes what changes would result in a different recommendation, making it actionable and scrutable for users. It leverages a polynomial-time algorithm to efficiently explore potential user actions that could alter recommendations, avoiding the computational inefficiency of evaluating all possible subsets of actions.

Furthermore, the paper validates the effectiveness of Prince through extensive experiments using Amazon and Goodreads datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms heuristic methods like those based on highest contributions or shortest paths. The usefulness of the explanations generated by Prince was also confirmed through a user study with Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing that users found them more comprehensible and useful compared to other methods.

The technical aspects of the solution presented in the paper revolve around the use of Personalized PageRank (PPR) and counterfactual reasoning within heterogeneous information networks (HINs) to generate minimal and meaningful explanations for recommendations. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### **1. Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN)**

The system models the data as a HIN where nodes represent entities such as users, items, categories, and reviews, and edges represent interactions like purchases, ratings, or reviews. This network is directed and weighted, reflecting the strength and direction of relationships, which are crucial for determining influence in recommendations.

### **2. Personalized PageRank (PPR)**

PPR is used to score the relevance of items to a particular user based on their past interactions. The PPR score represents the likelihood of reaching a particular node (item) from a specific start node (user) in a random walk that includes a teleportation step. Teleportation allows the random walk to jump back to the initial node with a certain probability, ensuring that the walk does not stray too far from the user's context.

### **3. Counterfactual Explanations**

The system identifies minimal sets of user actions that, if removed, would lead to a different item being recommended. This is done by:

- Identifying all user actions that contribute to the PPR score of the currently recommended item.
- Systematically evaluating which subsets of these actions, when removed, change the top recommendation. This involves recalculating PPR scores for potential recommendations after hypothetically removing certain actions.

### **4. Efficient Computation with Polynomial-Time Algorithm**

To avoid the inefficiency of checking all possible subsets of actions, the system uses a novel polynomial-time algorithm. This algorithm leverages the properties of PPR and the structure of the network to quickly identify the smallest set of actions necessary to change the recommendation. This involves:

- Calculating the contribution of each action to the PPR score of the recommended item.
- Using a heap data structure to efficiently manage and update the priority of actions based on their impact on the recommendation score.
- Iteratively removing the action with the highest impact and checking if the top recommendation changes.

### **5. Experimentation and Validation**

The paper validates the effectiveness of this approach using datasets from Amazon and Goodreads. They demonstrate that the Prince method can find the minimal and most relevant sets of actions that, if altered, would change the recommendation. This is contrasted with other methods that either take a heuristic approach or use less targeted algorithms, showing that Prince is both more efficient and produces better explanations.

### **6. User Study**

A user study conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that users find the counterfactual explanations generated by Prince to be more useful and comprehensible than those generated by baseline methods.

In summary, the technical approach of using counterfactual reasoning with PPR in a HIN framework allows the system to generate precise and minimal explanations for recommendations, which are both user-friendly and grounded in the actual data-driven influences on the recommendation system.

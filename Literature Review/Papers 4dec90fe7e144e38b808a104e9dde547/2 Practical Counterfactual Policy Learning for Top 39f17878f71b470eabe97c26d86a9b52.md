# 2: Practical Counterfactual Policy Learning for Top-ùêæ Recommendations

In the paper, the authors developed a counterfactual policy learning framework for top-K recommender systems, addressing technical challenges like importance weight explosion and scarce observations. They utilize counterfactual reasoning by applying inverse propensity scoring to adjust the biases in observed feedback, enabling robust policy optimization through a two-tower neural architecture and gradient-based methods. This approach systematically learns from what-if scenarios, enhancing the generalizability and effectiveness of the recommendation policies.

The paper you mentioned tackles the technical challenges in counterfactual policy learning for top-K recommendations by introducing a few innovative solutions. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the technical aspects of their solution:

### **1. Regularized Per-item Estimator**

The problem of importance weight explosion arises when the propensity scores (likelihood of an item being recommended under the current policy) are very small, leading to significant variance in learning outcomes. The authors propose a regularized estimator that specifically manages these extreme weights on a per-item basis, thus stabilizing the learning process. This estimator adjusts the weights used in the importance sampling to prevent extreme values from dominating the learning process.

### **2. Formulation to Handle Reward Distribution**

To avoid the sharp policy problem‚Äîwhere the learned policy becomes too deterministic and potentially overfits to a few high-reward items‚Äîthey introduce a formulation that more evenly distributes the probability mass among recommended items. This involves using a smoothed estimation approach that incorporates both the item features and user context into the decision-making process, promoting more robust and generalized policy learning.

### **3. Efficient Training Method**

Training efficiency is a critical issue due to the vast number of items and potential actions (item combinations) that the system must consider. The paper addresses this by:

- **Decomposing the policy learning problem** into manageable parts, where each part deals with the decision-making process for a single item given the context of previously chosen items. This reduces the complexity from considering all combinations simultaneously.
- **Applying advanced optimization techniques** such as the two-tower model, which separates the item and user features into different processing streams before merging them for the final decision-making step. This model facilitates more scalable and efficient computation.
- **Utilizing a policy gradient method** that adjusts the policy parameters in the direction that improves the expected reward, calculated via a gradient ascent approach. This method helps in fine-tuning the policy towards optimal performance by continuously updating the policy based on observed rewards.

### **4. Adaptive Techniques**

The framework adapts to different contexts and varying amounts of data by dynamically adjusting the learning parameters. This adaptation is crucial for handling real-world scenarios where some items or contexts might be underrepresented.

### **5. Practical Implementations**

The solutions proposed are not just theoretical; they include practical implementation strategies such as handling large-scale data through efficient data structures and parallel processing, which are essential for deploying these systems in real-world environments.

By integrating these techniques, the framework effectively tackles the inherent challenges of bias and inefficiency in traditional recommender system learning, leading to more accurate, fair, and robust recommendations. This approach is particularly valuable in environments with large and diverse item spaces where traditional methods struggle to maintain performance and fairness.

### **Introduction of Counterfactual Concept**

The counterfactual concept in this paper is introduced to overcome the selection bias inherent in the feedback data collected from a recommender system. In traditional settings, the system may learn only from user interactions that occurred under a specific policy (behavior policy), which can bias the model towards those interactions and ignore potential benefits of recommending other items that were not selected under the past policy.

### **Implementation in Their Solution**

The implementation of the counterfactual approach in their paper involves several key strategies:

1. **Importance Weighting**:
    - **Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS)**: To correct for the bias in observed data, the paper uses IPS, which involves weighting the outcomes by the inverse of the probability that these outcomes would have been observed under the historical policy. This allows the model to estimate what the rewards would likely be if the new policy had been in place instead, essentially simulating a counterfactual scenario.
2. **Policy Learning**:
    - The framework focuses on policy learning rather than value learning. While value learning methods try to estimate the value (or reward) associated with each possible action, policy learning directly optimizes the policy that decides which items to recommend.
    - By learning a new policy under the assumption that all items could have been recommended (not just those that were), the model uses counterfactual reasoning to estimate more unbiased rewards.
3. **Regularization and Smoothing**:
    - To manage the extreme values in importance weights and the instability they cause in learning, the paper introduces a regularized estimator for each item, which helps control the impact of rarely recommended items that could otherwise dominate the learning process due to high importance weights.
    - The formulation to balance the reward distribution and avoid overly sharp policies indirectly supports counterfactual reasoning by smoothing the decision process across a broader range of items, thus avoiding overfitting to the biased historical data.
4. **Handling Sparse Data**:
    - The framework addresses scenarios where certain items or user contexts are rarely observed, which is common in large-scale systems. This is tackled through adaptive techniques that adjust the learning process based on the availability and distribution of data, allowing the system to make more informed decisions in sparse data environments.

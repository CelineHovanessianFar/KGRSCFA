The researchers developed CLEAR, a framework using a graph variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate counterfactual explanations for graph-level prediction models. It maps graphs into a latent space, optimizing a loss function that combines similarity and prediction accuracy, and leverages an auxiliary variable to enhance causality, allowing it to effectively generalize counterfactuals to unseen graphs.

This paper introduces a novel framework called CLEAR (generative CounterfactuaL ExplAnation geneRator for graphs), which focuses on producing counterfactual explanations for graph-level prediction models. Unlike traditional counterfactual explanation (CFE) approaches that mainly deal with tabular or image data, CLEAR addresses unique challenges associated with graph data, such as optimizing in a discrete and disorganized space, generalizing on unseen graphs, and preserving causality without prior knowledge of the causal model.

The CLEAR framework uses a graph variational autoencoder to map graphs into a latent space, facilitating both optimization and generalization. This approach allows for the generation of counterfactuals that slightly modify the original graph to achieve a desired prediction outcome while adhering to underlying causal relationships. This is enhanced by leveraging an auxiliary variable that helps in identifying the latent causal model more effectively.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLEAR outperforms existing methods in various metrics such as validity, proximity, causality, and computational efficiency. The paper concludes that CLEAR not only advances the field of counterfactual explanations on graphs but also opens up new directions for incorporating more complex causal models and diversity into graph-based CFE generation.

The CLEAR framework tackles the generation of counterfactual explanations for graph data using a graph variational autoencoder (VAE) mechanism, addressing three primary challenges: optimization, generalization, and causality. Here's a breakdown of the technical aspects of their solution:

### **1. Graph Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**

**Encoder:** The encoder in CLEAR takes the node features and the graph structure (adjacency matrix) of an input graph along with a desired output label. It maps these inputs into a latent space representation 𝑍*Z*. The encoder is trained to approximate a posterior distribution 𝑄(𝑍∣𝐺,𝑌∗)*Q*(*Z*∣*G*,*Y*∗), which ideally should be close to a Gaussian prior 𝑃(𝑍∣𝐺,𝑌∗)*P*(*Z*∣*G*,*Y*∗). This Gaussian prior is parameterized by a mean and a covariance that depend on the desired label 𝑌∗*Y*∗.

**Decoder:** The decoder uses the latent representation 𝑍*Z* and the desired label 𝑌∗*Y*∗ to generate a counterfactual graph 𝐺𝐶𝐹=(𝑋𝐶𝐹,𝐴𝐶𝐹)*GCF*=(*XCF*,*ACF*). To make the optimization tractable, the adjacency matrix of the counterfactual graph is treated probabilistically. The decoder outputs a probabilistic adjacency matrix, which is then sampled to produce a discrete graph structure.

**Objective Function:** The optimization objective is based on the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). The loss function incorporates a similarity loss to ensure the counterfactual graph remains close to the original in terms of graph structure and node features. It also includes a counterfactual prediction loss to ensure the counterfactual graph meets the desired prediction outcome. The total loss is a combination of these losses along with the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior, which ensures the latent space embedding is regularized.

### **2. Promoting Generalization**

CLEAR is designed to generalize to unseen graphs. Once the VAE model is trained, it can generate counterfactuals for new graph instances without needing to be retrained. This capability stems from the model's ability to map any graph into a robust latent space and then generate counterfactuals from that space.

### **3. Incorporating Causality**

One of the novel aspects of CLEAR is its approach to handle causality without explicit prior knowledge of causal relationships within the data. CLEAR uses an auxiliary variable 𝑆*S* that helps in better identifying the underlying causal model. This auxiliary variable aids in conditioning the model during training, thus improving the identifiability of the latent causal factors from the observed data.

**Auxiliary Variable:** The auxiliary variable 𝑆*S* can be any relevant feature or label that helps distinguish different conditions or scenarios in the data. It is incorporated into both the encoder and decoder to guide the generation process and ensure that the counterfactual explanations are causally plausible.

### **4. Experimentation and Validation**

The paper validates the CLEAR framework through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The metrics used for evaluation include the validity of the counterfactuals (do they achieve the desired output?), proximity (how close are the counterfactuals to the original graphs?), and causality (do the counterfactuals adhere to known or inferred causal relationships?).

Overall, CLEAR addresses the complexities of generating counterfactual explanations on graph data with a sophisticated approach that balances the need for accuracy, generalization, and causality.

In the context of the paper, counterfactual explanations are used primarily to enhance the explainability of graph-based machine learning models. Here’s how they apply these explanations specifically:

1. **Understanding Model Decisions**: By generating counterfactuals that slightly modify the original graph (such as a network of collaborations in a grant application scenario), users can see what minimal changes might lead to a different decision by the model. This helps in understanding the key factors that influence the model's outcomes.
2. **Improving Decision-Making Processes**: For example, in a grant application scenario described in the paper, leaders could understand how increasing collaborations among team members could potentially lead to a successful grant application. This practical use helps in strategizing and optimizing team structures for desired outcomes.
3. **Training and Debugging Models**: By observing how small perturbations to the graph's structure or node features lead to changes in the output, developers can better understand the model's dependencies and potentially uncover biases or errors in the model's logic, leading to further refinement.

The paper emphasizes using counterfactual explanations to provide insights into how and why certain predictions are made, and what can be changed to alter those predictions, thus aiding users in better understanding and utilizing graph-based prediction models.

### **Original Scenario:**

- **Graph Representation**: Each node in the graph represents a team member, and each edge represents a collaboration between team members.
- **Model Prediction**: The graph is input into a machine learning model that predicts whether a grant application by this research team will be successful or not. Suppose the model predicts that the application will not be granted.

### **Counterfactual Case:**

- **Desired Outcome**: The team leader wants to know what changes could be made to increase the likelihood of the grant being approved.
- **Counterfactual Explanation**: The counterfactual explanation might suggest that increasing the density of connections between certain team members could lead to a successful grant application.
- **Graph Modification**: This could involve adding more collaboration links between specific team members who are less connected.

### **Explanation and Insight:**

- **Visual and Analytical Insight**: The counterfactual explanation visually and analytically demonstrates that by increasing collaborations (adding more edges in the graph), the prediction changes from a grant being denied to being approved.
- **Strategic Changes**: Based on this counterfactual, the team leader might encourage or organize more collaborative activities among team members to align with the successful counterfactual model.
